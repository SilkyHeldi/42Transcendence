# 42Transcendence

Transcendence is the final 42 School group project of the common core.
It consists of creating a web application that allows you to create an account, add and chat with friends and challenge people in a Pong game.

We used NestJS, Prisma and PostgresSQL for the database and a JWT system for authentication.
On the other hand, we used UnoCSS and VueJS for the frontend.
